lettuceSee
==========

Welcome to the documentation of the lettuceSee package. LettuceSee is a collection of algorithms developed for the 
quantification of plant images. 

Installation
------------
The lettuceSee package and its dependencies can be installed through the following methods:

PIP
^^^
The package is hosted on the python package index (PyPI) at https://pypi.org/project/lettuceSee/, and can be installed
through the command:

.. code-block:: bash
	
	pip install lettuceSee

Conda
^^^^^
There is no dedicated lettuceSee installation available within anaconda. If you want to install the package within
anaconda the following method is reccomended: First create and activate a new conda environment using the steps described in the
`anaconda documentation <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands>`_.
. Install pip into this environment using the command:

.. code-block:: bash
	
	conda install pip

The package can then be installed through pip with the command described in the PIP section. All further packages installed 
in this environment should be installed through pip, as installing packages through both conda and pip within the same 
environment can lead to unexpected interactions.
